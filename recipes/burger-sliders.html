    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These tasty burger sliders are easy to make with savory ground beef and shredded Cheddar cheese, baked in mini rolls until warm and gooey. These sandwiches remind me of those delicious mini burgers at my favorite fast-food restaurant! They are a perfect appetizer to bring to a party!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1.25 ounce) envelope onion soup mix</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese/li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>24 dinner rolls, split</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced pickles (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil and grease with cooking spray. Grease a sheet of aluminum foil; set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix ground beef and onion soup mix together in a large skillet; cook and stir over medium-high heat until beef is crumbly and evenly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>

        <li>Place roll bottoms on the prepared baking sheet. Spread beef mixture onto each bottom; cover with bread roll tops. Cover sliders with the prepared sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until burger sliders are heated through and cheese is melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve sliders with sliced pickles and enjoy!</li>
